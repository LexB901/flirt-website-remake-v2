                    Our Service contains content from and hyperlinks to websites, locations, platforms, and services operated, owned, and maintained by third parties. (“Third Party Services”). In addition, our Service contains features that allow you to interact with, connect
                    to, or access our Service through certain Third Party Services and third party devices (“Third Party Features”). For example, you use a Third Party Feature when you “like” or “share” content over social media through our Service. Remember
                    that third parties may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit information from you. Also, if you use a Third Party Feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to
                    and use information associated with your use of the Third Party Feature. If you publicly reference our Service on a Third Party Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Flirt in a tweet or post), we may use your reference
                    on or in connection with our Service.
                </p>
                <p class="text-xl">
                    Our Service also contains Tracking Technologies operated by third parties. For example, analytics services, such as Google Analytics, may use Tracking Technologies on our Service to help us analyze your use of the Service, compile statistic reports on
                    the Service’s activity, and provide other services relating to Service activity and internet usage. Similarly, ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Service and Third Party Services
                    to track your activities across time and services, and tailor ads to you based on your activities, which may include sending you an ad on a Third Party Service or third party device after you have left the Service (“Interest-based
                    Advertising”).

                    The information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Service, a Third Party Service, a Third Party Feature, or a third party device, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with
                    us, your rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. Flirt is not responsible for and makes no representations regarding the privacy practices of such third parties.
                    You should carefully read their own privacy policies before providing any information to such third parties. To the extent we combine information we receive from third parties with information we collect directly from you on the Service,
                    we will treat the combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

                    you opt-out of online behavioral advertising using any of these methods, the opt-out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt-out. Further, opting-out only means that the selected members should no longer
                    deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any thirdparties’

                    operates as a processor on behalf of our customers. The customers are the controllers and determine the purposes for which and the manner in which personal data are to be processed by Flirt. If you are a data subject in the EEA, see
